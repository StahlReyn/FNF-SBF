You can add as many portrait as you wanted. To add it just edit the second paramater in the dialogue, like for example:

:dad:bfNeutral:I am saying stuff

This would put the portrait named "bfNeutral" on the left side, the dad's side, and the dialogue will be "I am saying stuff"
The image is facing to the right (to you) in normal image, the game will mirror it on it's own when used on the other side.

When left blank it will default into bfPortrait

Keep in mind the game will automatically resize the portrait to fit into the box, and that also means stretching the image,
for best quality have the image already in be in square proportion. Other than that there are no real limits on resolution.
Smaller would be good though to minimize lag.

Have fun adding what ever questionable thing you want to put, there's a couple unused portrait to mess around.
